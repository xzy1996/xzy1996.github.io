title = {In-motion initial alignment method for a laser Doppler velocimeter-aided strapdown inertial navigation system based on an adaptive unscented quaternion H-infinite filter},
journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {With its advantages of high velocity measurement accuracy and fast dynamic response, the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDVs) is expected to replace the odometer (OD) in combination with a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) to give a higher-precision integrated navigation system. Since a LDV has higher velocity measurement accuracy and data update frequency than an OD and Doppler velocity log, a LDV is used for the first time in this paper to aid a SINS in in-motion alignment. Considering that some approximation is used in the alignment model, the uncertainty noise of the sensors during the motion process and the unknown noise parameters during the filter process, an adaptive unscented quaternion H-infinite estimator (AUSQUHE) is proposed. The proposed AUSQUHE method has high robustness since it combines the advantages of an unscented quaternion estimator and H-infinite filter. The adaptive threshold of the H-infinite filter and the adaptive measurement noise covariance matrix are introduced to make the filter adapt to the changing environment and accelerate the convergence of errors. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a vehicle field test with a normal LDV signal and a vehicle test with the LDV signal disturbed by noise. The results show that the proposed method has higher alignment accuracy, faster convergence speed and stronger robustness than the four other compared methods.}
