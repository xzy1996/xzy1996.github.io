<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Doppler velocity log (DVL) is usually employed to suppress the divergency of the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) in underwater navigation, which is not concealable due to high transmittance for acoustic wave in the water. To conduct underwater navigation task with high concealment, a differential laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) working at water track mode is integrated with SINS in this paper. The developed LDV measures the advance velocity of the underwater carrier with respect to the surrounding water in underwater navigation scenario with advantages of high concealment, high real-time performance, high update rate, light weight, and small dimension. A dynamic river test was conducted to validate the underwater navigation performance of SINS/LDV integrated system. The experimental results show that during the voyage of 4493s and 5271.8m, the maximum horizontal positioning errors of the proposed SINS/LDV integrated underwater navigation system is 27.8m and the relative position error is less than 0.6% with respect to total distance. Therefore, the water track LDV is practical to aid SINS in underwater navigation environment.
