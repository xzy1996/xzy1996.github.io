With ultra-high velocity measurement accuracy, laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) is promising to replace the odometer to provide vehicle velocity information in the process of land integrated navigation. This paper investigates the fast in-motion initial alignment for LDV-aided strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). Aiming at the problem that the installation misalignment angles and scale factor error of LDV will reduce the alignment accuracy and the alignment speed, a Robust Double Gain Square-Root Unscented Quaternion Estimator (RDGSR-USQUE) method with good effect at large misalignment angle is proposed. In RDGSR-USQUE, the inﬂuence of unknown parameter error is considered in the construction of process model and measurement model and a double gain structure is proposed to improve the convergence speed based on the usually neglected posterior measurement residual information. RDGSR-USQUE method improves the defects of the traditional Unscented Quaternion Estimator (USQUE) method, such as poor noise resistance, slow convergence speed under large misalignment angle and easy to lead to non-positive deﬁnite covariance matrix. This will help to estimate and compensate unknown parameter errors while estimating attitude, so as to improve the accuracy of process model and measurement model, and ﬁnally improve the accuracy of attitude estimation. The performance of the proposed scheme is veriﬁed by vehicle ﬁeld test. The results show that the proposed method has higher alignment accuracy, faster convergence speed and stronger robustness than three other compared methods, and the estimated installation misalignment angle and scale factor of LDV are satisfactory in general cases.
