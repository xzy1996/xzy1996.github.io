This software, developed on the Qt platform, provides an off-line solution for the SINS/LDV integrated navigation system. It can process data from IMU, GNSS, LDV, OD, and SFV sensors offline. It includes functions for:

* Purely inertial navigation
* SINS/GNSS integrated navigation (KF and AKF)
* SINS/LDV, SINS/OD, SINS/SFV integrated navigation system calibration
* SINS/LDV, SINS/OD, SINS/SFV dead reckoning
* SINS/LDV, SINS/OD, SINS/SFV integrated navigation
